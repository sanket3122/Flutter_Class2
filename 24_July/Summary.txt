## Summary:-
★learned Scaffold is a widget that creates a Baseapp for Us!
★About Hot Reload - if as developer there is need to change some part in code and want to see change at that time only than we can concept of use hot reload - Earlier as developer if some changes are done in code ,there was need to restart whole app ! But using hot reload - only that part of code will be reloaded/build/compile with in a Mili sec of time! For that variable is used called Build Context or we have to use buildfun inside it we have to pass argument called Build Context with varname! Inside Build fun/method we can wrap whole propertie of scaffold ,app bar etc!
★build() is a part of stateless widget which is a type of class so we have to use this class for build() !
★Than learned about Package - In Prog World or Lang world Modules which can have further prog files ,gives extra capability to code so in Prog world if we bundle together all modules  it is typically known as Package /Software or Library!
We can do any customisation in dart because of package used in top of Dart like flutter package !
And flutter is package contains lot of modules!
★Flutter stores prog files in SDK!
Continuing*
★In Prog Lang where we install some time extra SW are called as Package !
★In Dart if we want to store any Package/Library we use command PUB
Than learned practically to install a package !
